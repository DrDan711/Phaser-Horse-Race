V2, group work<br>
press the right cursor key -> to get them running, release to make them walk.

I wanted different color horses in the group<br>
I have 5 different spritesheets, but had to setup 5 different sets of animations. 
I'm wondering if there is a more code efficient way of doing this? But this got the job done. <br>
If anyone has any better ideas please send a comment.
